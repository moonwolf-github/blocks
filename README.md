[Libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) game with [ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley)
and [box2d](http://box2d.org/)

It's strictly for testing purposes - i want to test ECS approach with libgdx. So don't expect much progress here.

All assets and some code are taken shamelessly from various sources. Here are some credits:
